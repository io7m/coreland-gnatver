FreeBSD FSF (gcc) GNAT has version strings of the form:

  GNAT Version: 4.2.3

The same compiler on Debian simply has:

  4.2.3

The various different versions of GNAT from AdaCore have
strings such as:

  GNAT Version: GPL 2008 (20080521)
  GNAT Version: GAP 2005 (20050101)

The search patterns used in the package assume that the
Debian version string differences will be repeated across
any AdaCore compiler.
